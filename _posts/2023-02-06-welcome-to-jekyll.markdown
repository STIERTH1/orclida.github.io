Welcome to the `Orclida` Blog. The purpose of the `Orclida` blog is to provide regular updates on the product roadmap, milestone and new features developed by our Team. Feel free to browse the "Blog" section of the website to search topic and browse various posts.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
